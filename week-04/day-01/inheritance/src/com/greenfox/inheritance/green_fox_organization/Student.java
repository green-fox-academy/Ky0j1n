//Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
//
//        fields:
//        previousOrganization: the name of the student’s previous company / school
//        skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
//        methods:
//        getGoal(): prints out "Be a junior software developer."
//        introduce(): "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already."
//        skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
//        The Student class has the following constructors:
//
//        Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
//        Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0
